SQL - Covid-19 Data Exploration Project

This project explores the data to gain insights on the impact of Covid-19 on the world. It also digs into the details of the population regarding vaccinations.

SQL Server Data queries on:
1) Total cases v/s Total deceased - India. What is the Covid- 19 death rate in India?
2) Total cases v/s Population - India. What is the percentage of population infected?
3) Total cases v/s Population - Global. Which are the countries with the highest percentage of people infected?
4) Which are the countries,continents with highest deceased count?
5) Percentage of people vaccinated as per rolling dates using CTE
6) What is the percentage of people fully vaccinated, per country using TEMP tables?
7) Compare deceased percentage to vaccinated percentage of population using CTE
8) Creating a view for percentage of population vaccinated
9) Global deceased Percentage

Key SQL Functions and Clauses used to derive meaningful insights: 
1. Joins : To combine data from multiple tables.
2. Group by Clause: To group data based on a common attribute.
3. Order by Clause: For sorting data.
4. Aggregate functions SUM, MAX: For numerical calculations.
5. OVER Clause in Window functions along with Partition by 
6. WITH clause or Common Table Expression (CTEs) : For virtual temporary tables during querying
7. Temp tables also used for session specific querying in SQL
8. ROUND function : To round numbers to a specified number of decimal places.
9. CAST function : To change data types of specified data.
10. Select TOP : To show limited number of records
10. Other DDL commands - Create, Drop, Alter used with Tables, Columns and Views.
